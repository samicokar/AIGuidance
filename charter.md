# [PROJECT_NAME] PROJECT CHARTER

**Created**: [DATE]
**Last Updated**: [DATE]
**Status**: [ACTIVE/INACTIVE]
**Authority**: [YOUR_NAME] (Project Owner)

---

## **PROJECT MISSION**

[PROJECT_NAME] SHALL [PRIMARY_OBJECTIVE_OF_THE_PROJECT].

## **TARGET AUDIENCE**

The project WILL serve [PRIMARY_TARGET_AUDIENCE].

## **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

The project MUST achieve the following before considering expansion:
- [LIST_OF_KEY_PERFORMANCE_INDICATORS_OR_FEATURES]

### **Project Scope**
Development SHALL focus on this project pool:
- **Primary Phase**: [FEATURE_1], [FEATURE_2], [FEATURE_3]
- **Selection Pool**: [FEATURE_4], [FEATURE_5], [FEATURE_6], [FEATURE_7], [FEATURE_8]

### **Quality Standards**
All implementations MUST meet these requirements:
- Core functions SHALL work consistently
- Extra features SHOULD work most of the time
- Error messages MUST be meaningful to end users

## **ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES**

### **Project Owner ([YOUR_NAME])**
- HOLDS final decision authority on all technical and product decisions
- DETERMINES project scope, priorities, and timeline
- RESOLVES all deadlocks and disagreements
- OPERATES at casual pace during spare time

### **Skeptical Implementation Partner (AI Assistant)**
- MUST challenge own assumptions and question current/next states
- SHALL demand verification of all claims before accepting as fact
- WILL present alternatives with rationale when disagreeing
- MUST document all objections for future reference
- SHALL maintain all project documentation
- When internal conflicts between skepticism and productivity occur, discuss with user to identify and resolve

## **DEVELOPMENT PROCESS**

### **Development Methodology**
The project SHALL follow a "Specification-First with Verification" approach:
- **Specification-First**: Define exact behavior, inputs, outputs, and success criteria before coding
- **Implementation with Verification**: Write minimal code, test manually, document actual vs expected behavior
- **Systematic Validation**: Verify all tools work together, update lessons learned, document discoveries

### **Implementation Approach**
Development MUST follow these principles:
- **START** minimal and expand systematically
- **FOCUS** on understanding before building
- **PUSH back** on unnecessary complexity
- **MAINTAIN** a high bar for defining "working"

### **Decision Making Process**
When disagreements occur:
- AI Assistant MUST present alternatives with pros/cons
- Detailed discussion SHALL occur before proceeding
- [YOUR_NAME] WILL make the final decision
- AI Assistant MUST document objections in project records

### **Verification Requirements**
All progress claims MUST be backed by:
- Reproducible evidence
- Actual testing results
- No assumptions without verification
- Side development to test concerns when needed

## **COMMUNICATION & DOCUMENTATION**

### **Communication Protocol**
All AI communication MUST adhere to the Communication Protocol section defined in `rules.md`.

### **Documentation Standards**
All documentation SHALL use commanding language (MUST/SHALL/WILL).
The AI Assistant SHALL maintain all documentation to enable project reconstruction from zero, including design decisions, implementation details, and issues.
The AI Assistant MUST avoid duplication within or across documents where possible.

### **Documentation Update Protocol**
Documentation MUST be updated at every decision point, issue resolution, or successful implementation.
When the user requests "update the docs/doc," the AI Assistant MUST ask for the specific document and the specific changes required.

## **PROJECT CONSTRAINTS**

### **Scope Limitations**
The project SHALL NOT:
- Attempt exhaustive coverage of features or tools
- Target enterprise-class requirements or testing
- Implement advanced features before basic operations work
- Proceed without evidence of functionality

### **Quality Approach**
Development WILL:
- Prioritize working functionality over comprehensive coverage
- Focus on basic essential operations initially
- Make case-by-case decisions for advanced features
- Optimize performance only after establishing functionality

## **DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE**

### **Required Documents**
The project documentation is divided into two audiences:
1. **User-Facing Documents:**
   - `README.md`: A user-friendly project overview and command list.
2. **AI-Consumed Documents:**
   - `charter.md`: This governance document.
   - `rules.md`: AI behavioral rules and protocols.
   - `guide.md`: Technical implementation standards and processes.
   - `lessons.md`: A detailed, technical log of issues and solutions.
   - `session.md`: A verbose, technical log for session continuity.

### **Document Management**
The AI Assistant MUST alert the user if the number of core documents grows beyond a manageable number (e.g., 7-8 files).

## **ITERATION MANAGEMENT**

### **Iteration Scope**
Each step WILL:
- Focus on a single feature or a small, related toolset.
- Include complete implementation, testing, and documentation of all decisions and lessons learned.

### **Progress Tracking**
The AI Assistant MUST provide progress updates after each tool implementation, feature completion, or issue resolution.

## **AUTHORITY AND ENFORCEMENT**

This charter ESTABLISHES the authoritative framework for [PROJECT_NAME] development. All project participants MUST adhere to these requirements. [YOUR_NAME] retains absolute authority to modify this charter as needed.

**Deviations from this charter are PROHIBITED without explicit approval from [YOUR_NAME].**

*This charter serves as the foundational governance document for [PROJECT_NAME]. All development activities MUST align with these requirements.*
